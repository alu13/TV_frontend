# Tech Volunteers

This is a platform that connects Georgia Tech students to volunteer opportunities in the area. This is accomplished through several steps.

1. Scrape Non-profit/Volunteer websites for jobs in the local Atlanta area.
2. Provide an form where Nonprofits can submit/remove job opportunities
3. Store job opporuntiies in MongoDB.
4. Provide users with a space to search and submit applications for these opportunities.

This entire project uses a MERN stack with Azure hosting. Frontend and backend infrastructure are linked but separately hosted on Azure App Services.
